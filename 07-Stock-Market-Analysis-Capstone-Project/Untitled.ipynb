    "Skewness is a statistical measure that describes the asymmetry of a probability distribution. In other words, it indicates the degree to which a distribution deviates from symmetry. A perfectly symmetrical distribution has a skewness of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of skewness:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Positive Skewness (Right Skewness): If the distribution has a tail on the right side (larger values) that is longer or fatter than the left side, it is positively skewed. The mean is usually greater than the median in a positively skewed distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Negative Skewness (Left Skewness): If the distribution has a tail on the left side (smaller values) that is longer or fatter than the right side, it is negatively skewed. The mean is typically less than the median in a negatively skewed distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness can be calculated using different formulas, but one common method for sample skewness is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness=n(n−1)(n−2)∑i=1n(Xi−Xˉs)3Skewness=(n−1)(n−2)n​∑i=1n​(sXi​−Xˉ​)3\n",

    "    Skewness = 0: Symmetrical distribution.\n",
    "    Skewness > 0: Positively skewed (tail on the right).\n",
    "    Skewness < 0: Negatively skewed (tail on the left).\n",
    "\n",

    "Kurtosis is a statistical measure that describes the distribution of data points in a data set. It quantifies the \"tailedness\" of the data distribution, indicating whether the data are heavy-tailed (more extreme values) or light-tailed (less extreme values) compared to a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways to calculate kurtosis, but one common approach is to compare the distribution to a normal distribution. A normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3 (referred to as mesokurtic). Positive kurtosis indicates a distribution with heavier tails than the normal distribution (leptokurtic), while negative kurtosis indicates lighter tails (platykurtic).\n",
